# MCAAC-Ticket-Request-Survey-Generator

Getting Started
To run the event survey generator script and create a Qualtrics survey to streamline MCAAC committee member ticket request submissions, the required input is an Excel file with the following columns (not named in the header, following the format linked in this repo): "event name", "date", "time", "link", "notes". This can be refactored in the script if the input changes (see lines 9-16, which parses the file and extracts the relevant data).
